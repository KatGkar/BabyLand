BabyLand the project is an android application developed on Android Studio using solely Java and the FireBase RealTime Database provided by Google. BabyLand's main purpose is to provide an easy way to monitor a baby's health and development from a smartphone device. The app can be used by both parents and medical staff. BabyLand is my thesis for my bachelor's degree in the Informatics Department, at the University of Piraeus.
